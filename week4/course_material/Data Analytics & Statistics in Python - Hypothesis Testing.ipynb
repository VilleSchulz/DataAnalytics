    "## 📌 Choosing the Right Hypothesis Test\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow a clear decision-making process when selecting a statistical test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check data distribution**  \n",
    "   Use **Shapiro-Wilk test** or **histograms/KDE plots** to assess if the data is approximately normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Determine sample structure**  \n",
    "   - **One-sample**: Compare a group to a known value.\n",
    "   - **Two-sample**: Compare two independent groups.\n",
    "   - **Paired**: Compare the same group under two conditions.\n",
    "   - **Three or more groups**: Compare more than two independent samples (e.g., Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs Monero)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choose the appropriate test**  \n",
    "   Based on distribution and sample type:\n",
    "   - 🧪 **t-test**: Normal data, small sample (n < 30)\n",
    "   - 📊 **z-test**: Normal data, large sample (n ≥ 30)\n",
    "   - 📉 **Mann-Whitney U**: Non-normal, 2 independent groups\n",
    "   - 🔄 **Paired t-test**: Normal paired samples\n",
    "   - ✍️ **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**: Non-parametric alternative for paired samples (e.g., before/after with non-normal data)\n",
    "   - 📈 **Kolmogorov-Smirnov**: Compare to a theoretical distribution (e.g., normal)\n",
    "   - 🟦 **Chi-Square**: For categorical/binned data\n",
    "   - 🧮 **McNemar Test**: For paired binary categorical outcomes (e.g., yes/no before and after treatment)\n",
    "🧪 **ANOVA**: For comparing means of **three or more independent groups** (e.g., BTC vs ETH vs XMR). Assumes normality and equal variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpret Results**  \n",
    "   - If **p-value < 0.05** → reject null hypothesis → significant result  \n",
    "   - Otherwise, fail to reject → not enough evidence for difference\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Parametric vs Non-Parametric Test Map\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a visual guide for selecting between parametric and non-parametric tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parametric Tests** are statistical methods that assume underlying statistical distributions (usually normal). These tests include **t-tests**, **z-tests**, and **ANOVA**. They are powerful and efficient when assumptions are met, especially with large and symmetric datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-Parametric Tests**, on the other hand, do not assume a specific distribution. These are preferred when:\n",
    "  - Data is skewed or ordinal\n",
    "  - Sample sizes are small\n",
    "  - You can't confidently assume normality\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples include the **Mann-Whitney U**, **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank**, **Chi-Square**, **McNemar**, and **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S)** tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://stemcellthailand.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/parametric-vs-nonparametric.png' alt='Parametric vs Non-Parametric Tests' width='650'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "> ✅ **Comment**: This diagram helps clarify which statistical test to use based on assumptions about your data. If your data is clean, normal, and continuous → use parametric tests. Otherwise, go with non-parametric alternatives for more robust results."
